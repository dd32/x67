A plugin to mock/test a new UI for the WordPress updates screen.

== Description ==

A plugin to mock/test a new UI for the WordPress updates screen to bring it into the 21st century with a look, feel, and usability that we all expect from WordPress.

A few quick suggestions/thoughts on what this could mean:

* Take inspiration from the Mac Updates available screen
* List all updates within the one "table"
* Make Nightly builds easier to understand, so even the most basic developer understands
* Use Icons for all items, Plugin Icons, Theme screenshot, or fall-back to the Dashicons
* Postpone the check-for-new updates to a ajax call on the screen, spinner and all
* Single click update-all button which uses Ajax to perform the updates
* List updates installed in the last 30 days
 
**Contributing:** This plugin is available for forking/pull requests on [Github at dd32/x67](https://github.com/dd32/x67), all commits are sync'd to the WordPress.org plugin directory immediately.
