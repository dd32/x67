x67 - A New UI for WordPress Updates
===================================

A plugin to mock/test a new UI for the WordPress updates screen to bring it into the 21st century with a look, feel, and usability that we all expect from WordPress.

**Please see readme.txt for full package details.**

A few quick suggestions/thoughts on what this could mean:
 * Take inspiration from the Mac Updates available screen
 * List all updates within the one "table"
 * Make Nightly builds easier to understand, so even the most basic developer understands
 * Use Icons for all items, Plugin Icons, Theme screenshot, or fall-back to the Dashicons
 * Postpone the check-for-new updates to a ajax call on the screen, spinner and all
 * Single click update-all button which uses Ajax to perform the updates
 * List updates installed in the last 30 days

This plugin can be contributed to through Github, however up-to-date nightlies are available for download from WordPress.org and within your WordPress dashboard.
You can find the plugin at https://wordpress.org/plugins/x67/.
The copy on WordPress.org is updated with every GitHub commit, so unless you're submitting patches, it's advised to use the WordPress.org packages.
